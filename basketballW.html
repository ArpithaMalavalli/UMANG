              <h2 class="mb-3">RULES:</h2>
              <h3>Teams/number of players:</h3>
</p>Two teams of maximum 12 players each, with five players of each team on the court at any time.
Teams may make as many substitutions as they like.</p>

<h3>The objective:</h3>
<p>The objective of the game is to put the ball in the opposing team’s basket.
  The team with the most points at the end of the game wins.</p>
<h3>Duration (30 minutes):</h3>
<p>The game consists of four periods of 8 minutes each, with a break of 2 minutes between the period.
If the scores are tied, overtime periods of three minutes will be played until one team has more points than the other (at the end of the 3-minute period)</p>

<h3>Scoring:</h3>
<p>A basket scored from near the basket (inside the three-point arc) is worth two points.
A basket scored from far (beyond the three-point arc) is worth three points.
When shooting a free throw, each free throw is worth 1 point.</p>

<h3>Rules for the offense:</h3>
<p>The basketball team on offense is the team with the basketball. When a player has the basketball there are certain rules they must follow:</p>
<ul>
  <li>  The player must bounce, or dribble, the ball with one hand while moving both feet. If, at any time, both hands touch the ball or the player stops dribbling, the player must only move one foot. The foot that is stationary is called the pivot foot.</li>
  <li>  The basketball player can only take one turn at dribbling. In other words, once a player has stopped dribbling they cannot start another dribble. A player who starts dribbling again is called for a double-dribbling violation and looses the basketball to the other team. A player can only start another dribble after another player from either team touches or gains control of the basketball. This is usually after a shot or pass.</li>
  <li>  The ball must stay in bounds. If the offensive team looses the ball out of bounds the other team gets control of the basketball.</li>
  <li>  The players hand must be on top of the ball while dribbling. If they touch the bottom of the basketball while dribbling and continue to dribble this is called carrying the ball and the player will lose the ball to the other team.</li>
  <li>  Once the offensive team crosses half court, they may not go back into the backcourt. This is called a backcourt violation. If the defensive team knocks the ball into the backcourt, then the offensive team can recover the ball legally.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Rules for the Defense:</h3>
<p>The team on defense is the team without the basketball.</p>
<ul>
  <li> The main rule for the defensive player is not to foul. A foul is described as gaining an unfair advantage through physical contact. There is some interpretation that has to be made by the referee, but, in general, the defensive player may not touch the offensive player in a way that causes the offensive player to lose the ball or miss a shot.</li>
</ul>
<h3>Rules for Everyone:</h3>

  <ul>
  <li>  Although the foul rule is described above as a defensive rule, it applies exactly the same to all players on the court including offensive players.</li>
  <li>  Basketball players cannot kick the ball or hit it with their fist.</li>
  <li>  No player can touch the basketball while it is traveling downward towards the basket or if it is on the rim. This is called goaltending. (touching the ball on the rim is legal in some games). Every player on the court is subject to the same rules regardless of the position they play. The positions in basketball are just for team basketball strategy and there are no positions in the rules.</li>
</ul>
<p>Decisions will be made to the best of the referee`s ability according to the Laws of the Game and the ‘spirit of the game’ and will be based on the opinion of the referee who has the discretion to take appropriate action within the framework of the Laws of the Game.
The decisions of the referee regarding facts connected with play, including whether or not a basket is scored and the result of the match, are final. The decisions of the referee, and all other match officials, must always be respected.
If a referee is incapacitated, play may continue under the supervision of the other match officials until the ball is next out of play.</p>
